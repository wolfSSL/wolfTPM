## Crypto Operation APIs
2. wolfTPM2_ECDHEGenKey - No direct test coverage
3. wolfTPM2_ECDHEGenZ - No direct test coverage

## System Management APIs
4. wolfTPM2_SetCommand - No direct test coverage

## TPM2 Core APIs Missing Test Coverage

## Policy APIs
5. TPM2_PolicyPhysicalPresence - No direct test coverage
6. TPM2_PolicyTemplate - No direct test coverage
7. TPM2_PolicyAuthorizeNV - No direct test coverage

## Hierarchy Management APIs
8. TPM2_HierarchyControl - No direct test coverage

Notes:
1. APIs marked as missing test coverage have no direct tests verifying their functionality and return code checking
2. Some APIs may be indirectly tested through other functions but lack explicit test coverage
3. This list excludes APIs that are tested through example files or unit tests
4. Focus is on public APIs marked with WOLFTPM_API
